# traindb-benchmark

TrainDB is a ML-based approximate query processing engine that aims to answer time-consuming analytical queries in a few seconds. TrainDB will provide SQL-like query interface and support various DBMS data sources.

The primary goal is to perform the objective benchmark for approximate query processing performance.
For quantitative AQP evaluation, we conduct the TrainDB experiments compared to two competitive approaches including ML-AQP, and VerdictDB.

## Competitive approaches

* VerdictDB: [https://github.com/verdict-project/verdict](https://github.com/verdict-project/verdict)
* ML-AQP: [https://github.com/Skeftical/modelbasedaqp](https://github.com/Skeftical/modelbasedaqp)
